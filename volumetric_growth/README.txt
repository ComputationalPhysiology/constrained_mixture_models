This folder contains a simple script to check the growth model from
Kerckhoffs et al (2012) in a simple zero-dimensional setting, equivalent to a 
uniform unit cube under uni-axial stretch. The Python file contains
code to plot the growth tensor components and other relevant quantities of the
model, while the derivation and resulting plots are found in the Latex folder.
