  abstract = {As an initial step to investigate stimulus-response relations in growth and remodeling (G\&R) of cardiac tissue, this study aims to develop a method to simulate 3D-inhomogeneous volumetric growth. Growth is regarded as a deformation that is decomposed into a plastic component which describes unconstrained growth and an elastic component to satisfy continuity of the tissue after growth. In current growth models, a single reference configuration is used that remains fixed throughout the entire growth process. However, considering continuous turnover to occur together with growth, such a fixed reference is unlikely to exist in reality. Therefore, we investigated the effect of tissue turnover on growth by incrementally updating the reference configuration. With both a fixed reference and an updated reference, strain-induced cardiac growth in magnitude of 30\% could be simulated. However, with an updated reference, the amplitude of the stimulus for growth decreased over time, whereas with a fixed reference this amplitude increased. We conclude that, when modeling volumetric growth, the choice of the reference configuration is of great importance for the computed growth.},

  abstract = {Adult cardiac muscle adapts to mechanical changes in the environment by growth and remodeling (G\&R) via a variety of mechanisms. Hypertrophy develops when the heart is subjected to chronic mechanical overload. In ventricular pressure overload (e.g. due to aortic stenosis) the heart typically reacts by concentric hypertrophic growth, characterized by wall thickening due to myocyte radial growth when sarcomeres are added in parallel. In ventricular volume overload, an increase in filling pressure (e.g. due to mitral regurgitation) leads to eccentric hypertrophy as myocytes grow axially by adding sarcomeres in series leading to ventricular cavity enlargement that is typically accompanied by some wall thickening. The specific biomechanical stimuli that stimulate different modes of ventricular hypertrophy are still poorly understood. In a recent study, based on in-vitro studies in micropatterned myocyte cell cultures subjected to stretch, we proposed that cardiac myocytes grow longer to maintain a preferred sarcomere length in response to increased fiber strain and grow thicker to maintain interfilament lattice spacing in response to increased cross-fiber strain. Here, we test whether this growth law is able to predict concentric and eccentric hypertrophy in response to aortic stenosis and mitral valve regurgitation, respectively, in a computational model of the adult canine heart coupled to a closed loop model of circulatory hemodynamics. A non-linear finite element model of the beating canine ventricles coupled to the circulation was used. After inducing valve alterations, the ventricles were allowed to adapt in shape in response to mechanical stimuli over time. The proposed growth law was able to reproduce major acute and chronic physiological responses (structural and functional) when integrated with comprehensive models of the pressure-overloaded and volume-overloaded canine heart, coupled to a closed-loop circulation. We conclude that strain-based biomechanical stimuli can drive cardiac growth, including wall thickening during pressure overload.},
